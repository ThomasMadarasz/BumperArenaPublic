# BumperArena

This repository contains a copy of some of the project files for Bumper Arena, a game developed by Firestarter Games.

The sole purpose of this repository is to showcase my work for hiring purposes. You are allowed to browse the code, but not to modify or use it.

Bumper Arena is a party game where players drive bumper cars through various arenas, each featuring different mini-games.
I mainly worked as a Gameplay Programmer on this project. You can find all the scripts in the [features folder](https://github.com/ThomasMadarasz/BumperArenaPublic/tree/main/Assets/_/Features).
